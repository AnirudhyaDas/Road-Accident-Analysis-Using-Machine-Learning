# Road-Accident-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning
# 🔍 Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze a road accident dataset to uncover hidden patterns, understand factors contributing to accident severity, and explore how time, driver characteristics, and vehicle types influence road safety. The analysis uses **feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering,** and **time series modeling** to gain actionable insights.

# 📁 Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains information about road accidents, including the following features:

Time: Timestamp of the accident
Day_of_week: Day the accident occurred
Age_band_of_driver: Age category of the driver
Driving_experience: Driver's years of experience
Type_of_vehicle: Vehicle involved
Area_accident_occured: Urban, rural, office, etc.
Lanes_or_Medians: Road layout
Types_of_Junction: T-junctions, crossings, etc.
Cause_of_accident: Main reason for the accident
Accident_severity: Target variable – Slight Injury, Serious Injury, or Fatal Injury
